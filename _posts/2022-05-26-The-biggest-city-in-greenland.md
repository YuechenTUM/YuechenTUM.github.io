<p>Sisimiut lies roughly 320 kilometres north of the capital, Nuuk, and about 75 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle.<sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/greenlandarcticl0000etai/page/8/mode/2up" style="text-decoration: none;">[1]</a></sup> Its name, drawn from the Greenlandic words sisi, meaning "fox den," and miut, meaning "those who live in,"<sup><a href="https://ordbog.gl/2018-kal-eng/#e14271" style="text-decoration: none;">[2]</a></sup> conjures an image of resilient people who have carved out a life in this stark and untamed expanse, and fostering an intimate bond with the natures. Formerly known as Holsteinsborgâ€”a name after Johann Ludwig Holstein that carries the memory of its colonial past.<sup><a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisimiut" style="text-decoration: none;">[3]</a></sup></p>
